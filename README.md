# Art-Prompt-Generator

#Hello! You are looking at the code for the second version of Art Prompt Generator! This started out as a text-based tool, but I wanted to add a GUI, and so, using PySimpleGUI, I was able to recreate the text-based tool with one that has a window with functional buttons that you can press as many times as you want to get different prompts!

#For the GUI portion, I used Example 2 on the PySimpleGUI page of the PyPI website (https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/) as a framework for the GUI, just changing what buttons and text would appear on screen, as well as adding my own events so that when buttons were pressed, they would deliver the correct prompt. I hope you enjoy!
